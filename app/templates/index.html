                As an intern at <span class="emphasis">Kinase AI</span>, I have learned things beyond my college curriculum. My interest in <span class="highlight">scientific discovery</span> led me to grab this opportunity to experience this field that I am curious about. A little FYI, before entering college as a STEM student, I loved unraveling <span class="emphasis">chemical processes</span>, how these tiny molecules interact to form cells, and how those cells build the complex systems that make up humans, plants, and animals.
            </p>
            
            <p class="story-paragraph">
                In my time in this internship, I have explored the <span class="highlight">structure of a virus</span>, the proteins, how antibodies work, and aside from peptide that usually being used on skincare, I discovered that it is not limited to being an ingredient to my daily routine. Kidding aside, the <span class="emphasis">dengue virus</span> is a huge threat worldwide, and being able to contribute even a small piece toward understanding or combating it was both humbling and exciting.
