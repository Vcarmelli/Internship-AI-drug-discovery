# ðŸ§¬Dengue Drug Discovery
<h3>Molecular Docking Viewer</h3>

This web-based Molecular Docking Viewer was developed as part of my internship project at **Kinase AI**. This was created in support of my capstone project entitled, "*AI-Driven Design and In Silico Evaluation of Peptide Inhibitors for Dengue Virus 3 Envelope Protein*". 

This web application focuses on visualizing molecular docking results for peptideâ€“protein interactions in a clear, interactive interface to support antiviral drug research.
